compares to SwitchML; uses Tofino (but discovers limitations); moves to Banzai
open-source switch architecture

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9463943

Tofino has no multiplication in its ALU

## NetCL: A Unified Programming Framework for In-Network Computing

more details about multiplication; memory is stage local

Table lookup based FP implementation, approximation, 7 stages?


# DPA/DPU communication acceleration


# Other open questions
  * Is a single copy enough? -> probably need rdma capable nics

  * Can we avoid cpu involvement for memory copy?

  * Administrative side: Where to put code, notes, ...? shared (lrz gitlab?) or
    somewhere local to me?
